    <h1>Typography test page with a very long H1 element so that we can test line height</h1>
    <p>This next paragraph includes‚ <strong>emboldened text</strong>‚ and also some <em>text‚ set in italics</em>. You
        can also set‚ text to be both <em><strong>emboldened and italicised</strong></em>‚ if you wish. We can also use
        this paragraph to test <span style="text-decoration: underline;">underlined text</span>. Obviously, you’d not
        want to use underlined text as it makes text looks like a hyperlink. Finally, we can also set <del>some text
            with strikethrough</del> to check that that style works too. Before we take a look at heading styles, let’s
        just check that the Blockquote style is working:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_blockquote.asp">
        <p>The <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_blockquote.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML
                &lt;blockquote&gt; tag</a>‚ is a semantic element used to define a quote from another source.
        </p>
        <p>Some more text here.</p>
        <p><strong>- Takeda</strong></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Heading 2 – Similarly, this will probably push to two lines as well</h2>
    <p>A hyperlink should be styled like this - <a href="?">I am a hyperlink</a>.</p>
    <p>Headings are used to separate blocks of text by level of importance. By default a page title on a website is
        always set in Heading 1 because it is the most important heading on the page. A page’s H1 is an important factor
        for ‘on page’ SEO. You can see that this paragraph is prefaced with a Heading 2 – the second level of heading
        importance.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>this is a new blockquote.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <p>This section of text is prefaced with a Heading 3. We’ll stick in some Latin text just to bulk the paragraph out
        a bit. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque sapien metus, faucibus eget massa
        vel, dictum suscipit mauris. Proin tempor metus est, vel aliquet risus pharetra sed. Curabitur nec semper nisi,
        vitae egestas turpis. Nunc sit amet magna dignissim tortor suscipit dignissim.</p>
    <p>Now let’s add a horizontal line below this paragraph to check that they are working.</p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <p>Gosh, we’re at a level 4 Heading already. That means that this paragraph should only contain text that is
        supportive of the main content as opposed to being of high significance to it. While we’re here, we’ll take a
        quick look at another text style; Preformatted text:</p>
    <pre>Preformatted text, set in the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_pre.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML &lt;pre&gt; tag</a> is designated as having 'unusual' formatting although in practice, most people use it to display computer code.</pre>
    <p>Ok, we’re making good progress but we still have a few more default styles to look at.</p>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <p>We’re really getting to the least important heading styles now. Unlike H1, H2 and H3 headings, H4, H5 and H6 are
        unlikely to be considered by search engines when evaluating a page of content. Therefore, they should only be
        considered for presentation styles as opposed to SEO significance. However, while we’re here, let’s look at an
        unordered list, often known as a bullet list.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unordered lists are written in HTML using the &lt;ul&gt;tag with ul standing for Unordered List*</li>
        <li>It is unordered as each list item has a graphical ‘bullet’ as opposed to a number</li>
        <li>Unordered lists can be used used for lots of things and should always be used if any form or ordering in not
            required</li>
        <li>Like any other typographical element, unordered lists can display <a
                href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_sup.asp">superscript</a> and <a
                href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_sub.asp">subscript</a> elements. Superscript elements are often
            used to show footnotes‚ like this<sup>[1]</sup> while subscript elements are often used in element names
            like this: H<sub>2</sub>0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Obviously there will be times when you need an ordered list, also known as a numbered list. For those situations
        you need the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ol.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML &lt;ol&gt;
            tag</a> with ol standing for Ordered List:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>As you can see, ordered lists include numbers</li>
        <li>These numbers will automatically adjust themselves as you add, edit and remove list items to keep the list
            in numeric order</li>
        <li>Despite the existence of this wonderful tag, people still seem to like to add 1.) 2.) and 3.) to the start
            of paragraphs rather than use an ordered list.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>With that all sorted, we’ll take a quick look at H6 and the last few styles.</p>
    <h6>This text is set in Heading 6. It will be useful for small print.</h6>
    <p>As you can see, we usually use heading 6 for small print. It’s of such minor importance that it is unlikely to be
        used by search engines as part of the ‘on page’ SEO quality of a page. Therefore, why not use it as a
        presentational style?</p>
    <p>Now‚ let’s just run over some quick notes on adding typographical content to the website. It makes sense to do
        this in the form of an unordered list so here goes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If you need to insert a symbol into your text, use the ‘Special characters’ icon. It looks like an omega
            sign. From there you’ll have access to all manner of symbols such as ™ and ©. You’ll also find accented
            characters such as Ä and ã as well as fractions like¼ and ¾.</li>
        <li>When pasting text from another source, be sure to click the ‘Paste as text’ icon before you paste. This will ensure any formatting is removed. Failure to do this can lead to superfluous
            HTML being inserted into your pages</li>
        <li>To remove formatting from selections of text, use the ‘Clear formatting’ icon</li>
        <li>Err away from using the left align, right align and centre align options. This website has been programmed
            to align text correctly based on its context so you should never need to align text. If you are tempted to
            use the ‘Justify’ option you probably shouldn’t be allowed to use a computer ever again!</li>
    </ul>
