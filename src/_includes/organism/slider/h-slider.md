## Documentation

Splide plugin [documentation can be found here](https://splidejs.com/options/)

## Usage

There are three data attributes that can be used to control when the slider loads/unloads.

- `data-init-min`: The slider will only initialise after this amount of items. Default is `2`.
- `data-disable`: Disable slider functionality. Default is `false`.
- `data-disable-desktop`: Disable sldier functionality on desktop only. Will initialise again on mobile. Default is `false`.
